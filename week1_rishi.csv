XxRfwkKi-FjwM8qsbXVNbw,"The only reason why I sometimes end up here is because there are not really that many alternatives in the vicinity (Dunkin' Donuts is not doing it for me) -- but I always regret having eaten unhealthy fastfood the moment I exit the restaurant. Next time, I'll better go to Star Market next door, buy some food, and prepare it myself. Or avoid this area around lunchtime altogether.",4,1,female
V7RTSW9nVIk6cI-Uqy0r9Q,"You do not go to the Greenhouse Coffee Shop expecting a gastronomical event.  You go to the Greenhouse Coffee Shop for a delicious piece of chocolate cake and some coffee.  You go expecting sticky tables and spots on your silverware.  You eat your cake, you look out the window watching the brilliant mix of Harvard Squares and you eat your tight cake.     Gary read a few things on poor service and Gary needs to speak out.  The man who brought a delicious mountain of chocolate cake to Gary's table was probably the sweetest man ever.  He was quick with coffee refills, made friendly banter, and even cut Gary a deal on the a la mode (sometimes you need a little something extra with your chocolate cake mountain).  When asked about the location of the bathrooms, Gary will admit his chocolate cake smile turned momentarily into a frown.  However, the waiter was quick to point out alternative bathroom locations thus turning Gary's frown right back upside down.    As for the no credit issue?  Gary burned off a whopping 3.4 chocolate cake calories jaunting to the ATM across the street and used the change to cart his bloated, sugar coma self back home in a taxi.",2,1,female
iLTXPskInwzcEoz0Wy6zig,"It is nothing short of a miracle if this place is open.    My girlfriend loved the lentil soup she once had at this place.     So we tried to visit this place at various times, and irrespective of when we went (believe me, we tried going at all kinds of times) - it used to be closed.    Maybe they were renovating or something then - I dont know, whatever it was, it did not make great business sense.    Anyway this once when we managed to find it open (we were really excited to go in, I remember), we had the lentil soup again (this time it was ok, clearly there is not much consistency in the cook's recipes).     But should say that the food was not too bad. I think we had some veggie soup as well, and that was also not bad.    5/10 for the food, 0/10 for their hours.",2,1,male
NwzmjuZ16KjOXS8YJ-TBQg,"There are only 3 spaces in front for people like me who want to take their food to go but aren't lazy enough to go through the drive ""thru"".    Of those 3 spaces, a manager-looking employee is parked in one - screwing over the customers.  Big parking lot in back. Employees don't park in prime customer spaces!    As for ordering, why do I have to recite my order to a guy who is pressing the same buttons I could press?   Why not self serve registers?  The guy fucjed up my order. I can do that myself and have no one to blame.  Honestly, why hire people who can't understand English to speak English to people who are twice as intelligent as the guy fukcing up the order?  Waste of a paycheck.  They should all be cooking, prepping & serving not taking orders.  GROCERY STORES HAVE SELF SERVE.  WHY NOT HERE?  AIRPORTS, PRINT YOUR OWN TICKET KIOSKS.    Why create a  faulted step between the customer and their order?????",4,2,male
3f7zOzoas29aWtEpZ91UPg,"I've eaten here before about four and a half years ago before I moved to Asia, and it wasn't bad.  I remember the place being pretty good.  I was thinking about taking the subway to the Theater District to P.F. Chang's for two orders of lettuce wraps, and I should have gone to P.F. Changs. Anyway, it has the typical Sports Bar Menu. I asked for unsweetened ice tea, took a sip and said, ""Hey, what's wrong with this tea."" It isn't brewed and it tasted like crap. It was a mix, so I bought a Stella Artois draft. OK. Because I was in Boston I ordered a crock of clam chowder ($6) and it was pretty good, except that it hat too many potatoes in it. Then I ordered a large salad with grilled shrimp($12). Terrible. The shrimp was grilled frozen shrimp and the rest of the salad was sadly bad. I am used to a good sports bar in CT, the Wood N' Tap, and this place suffers by comparison. I would have given it 1 star, but the clam chowder wasn't horrible.",2,1,male
lQu8y5Dton8ucgvptwh_EQ,"The food is below average. The service is OK and I guess if you want to drink some beers then it's fine, but it seems that it's such a waste of real state space.  I wish the mayor of Cambridge would try to revamp Kendall Square by opening better restaurants. Why is it that MIT doesn't get cool restaurants like Harvard? Not fair.",4,1,female
g3_FPQW2lK0k67HFUAWzug,"The same guys behind the Sapporo in Porter Sq. bring another location to the food court of the shiny new H Mart. Now you can have mediocre ramen at Porter or even worse food at higher prices here.   Noodles are the same: medium-thin wavy that are too soft.   House broth is still the chicken/veggie, which is decent with OK flavor and body. The Miso is still tasteless. Two additions here are a Shio and I believe some sort of Tonkotsu (called Central). The Shio uses the same house broth but just gets more salt dumped into it. Blech. I have not tried the Central because about 2 weeks after opening, it and the Shio have not been available anymore. ""Sold Out"" on the menu board. Probably a good thing to get rid of them.  Pork is done differently here. You get one thicker slab that is charred on a side. Kind of tough without much flavor.    With this new outlet Sapporo firmly cement themselves at the bottom of the list for area ramen. C'mon guys, this isn't the 1990's when you were the only players around. Can't get away with lousy ramen anymore.",2,1,male
yrOF3bn45U-eK04LgzhlxQ,Rather disappointing. The house ramen broth had a bad meat flavor. The spicy ramen was dull. $23 for two bowls of is a rip-off.,4,2,female
AAVwqnUVZLu8fnQ-CXwiKA,"Serious competition to Brookline Spa for best tuna sub in the Boston area.  Cheap, close-ish to Kendall and Lechmere, and fast, this has just about everything I could want from a sandwich shop.  Stay the way you are!",2,1,female
HeR3xoaUaQ3lUd4PuhAiOA,"Some of the best NYC style pizza I've found in the area, and interesting topping options too.",2,1,male
05uNxmypHhuCtHBfPphtIg,Stopped by for lunch and tried the California turkey sandwich.  Good amount of meat and good size sandwich.  If you're not starving half a sandwich might be enough for lunch.  They also have 1-2 hot food specials that looked decent.  I will definitely give this place another try in the future.  There are also a couple tables outside which will be nice if there is no construction around.,4,2,female
#NAME?,"The Porter Exchange is uniquely Cambridge. Located in a 1920s Art Deco-style Sears building, it's the place to visit for steaming udon, donburi or gyoza; cheap sushi; bubble tea; Dice-K paraphernalia; Japanese baked goods; handmade crafts; and random ingredients from the Asian market, Kotobukiya. Half a dozen food stalls line a crowded corridor, where lithe waitresses cart hot tea and tofu dishes at reasonable prices. They post menus with pictures to make comparison shopping easy.     In addition to the plethora of mostly Japanese stores, the Exchange also features a first rate jewelry store, a second rate sports supply store, and a third rate bookstore. Also, the Art Institute of Boston has a small gallery tucked into a corner of the Exchange, but I have never visited the space. Unfortunately, Rustic Kitchen relocated to the theater district. Thankfully, the Gap relocated too.",2,2,male
URJdnyZgABi-F3GPdvE5Eg,"This place is pretty delicious.  It's a deliciousness that you certainly pay a premium for, but that doesn't make it any less delicious.    The bagel here is a bit more like a California bagel than a real New York bagel, but I have zero issues with that at all.    The quality of the spreads and toppings is first rate, and their bagel is definitely better than most.",4,1,male
XvH5919dX_EryH41kF8bJQ,"This place is pretty good with speedy delivery. Here is how it scored:    Boat noodle soup with beef $12.95 4/5 pretty tasty    Grilled squid $7.95 4/5 I loved this dish but I LOVE squid. Much healthier than fried squid.     Chicken satay $7.50 3.5/5 pretty well executed.     9ZAAB salad roll $6.95 3/5 Meh, OK but I have had better.     I liked this place and will return. Check it out!",4,2,male
3RsI3WjTZuRJB-SM3cSS9A,"Drinks/appetizers.  Drinks were 5-star, appetizers were 3-star.  For example: fried zucchini with dip - too much ""fry"" taste, too boring ""dip"" taste, and man does not want zucchini alone.",4,2,female
2UerRM6lx1MPvs8TRX74dQ,"Great selection of beers, and awesome live music. The food was delicious. Very friendly and attentive staff. This is a great neighborhood bar & grill.",2,2,female
RV6Ctb--3_CtHtdqYqe0Mg,"Every time I come here, a machine is ""broken."" Today it was the latte machine, last time it was the McFlurry machine. Obviously nobody felt like making a latte today and blaming a broken machine was the easiest way out.    The employees are lazy and have zero customer service skills; they have no sense of urgency and the line is always long. It took 20 minutes today to get a snack wrap and a pre-made parfait from the refrigerator.    If you want $15/hr, why don't you act like $15/hr employees?     Avoid this place.",2,1,female
kLP2QIWMMoRVASs4DTNm7A,"I can't believe I'm Yelping about McDonald's but here it goes. Because our first choice for breakfast didn't pan out, we decided to just grab something quick near our hotel. The place seems to have been newly renovated.    As we approach the counter to order, the lady motioned us to their kiosk instead. As I grabbed some seats, my husband is punching away at the kiosk. Then he goes to the counter to pay and comes back with a table number so they can bring the food to you. I asked him what took so long, he said, the thing was asking him a lot of questions. Geez, it would have been much faster to place your order at the counter.    I always ordered the Sausage Egg McMuffin. It didn't taste as good as the one I usually have back home in NY/NJ. My son thought so too. My husband ordered the Big Breakfast w/Hotcakes Meal and he said the eggs were the best he ever had at McDonald's.     While eating, a guy was mopping the floor. For me, it's a bit unappetizing. What bothered me was that he was mopping inches away from my feet. I felt obligated to lift my feet up so he can mop the entire area. Who does that?    Well, that's my review for a fast food place, probably my last one too.",2,2,male
vfqNFwLQ9KNThYQbMrXcBQ,I used to LOVE Cambridge Coffee and Pizza shop but something has gone wrong - they screw something up (without fail) every single time we order something. It's nice to order breakfast and have it delivered but there have GOT to be other places out there (or we'll just cook ourselves). That's it - no more of this darned place.,2,2,female
H83y711pLDspdbvAFupjhQ,Steak and cheese sub was good but the meatball sub was gross and weird. The pizza came cold and was very mediocre. The whole thing was questionable because they had to come pick up the money first and said they needed a credit card and then come back to deliver the food..   You can't expect much at 2 am though   Chicken fingers we're really good though,4,2,male
969EbzCAWphbdEZ-KXBuSw,"This is a ramen bar hidden within a small food court next to H Mart (Asian grocery store). Sometimes, one can find a little gem in these types of locations - this was not the case here. I ordered the vegetarian ramen and I was massively disappointed. It was not ramen, but noodle soup with some sad vegetables and pieces of very cold tofu. The broth contained no flavour - it was simply hot water with soy sauce. Worse still, the price was abhorrent for the quality and quantity.",2,1,female
qBF1AaQjD2g_AQbaihaO0g,"This is the bar at the Kendall Square Marriott. Its ok. Standard pub grub like burgers ($10-11), club sandwiches, salads, and appertizers (think chicken wings, spinach artichoke dip). The place is not too quick for lunch. The food is boring and if you like pub grub I would head over to either Cambridge Brewing or Tommy Doyles at Kendall One.",4,2,male
hzDbi89y8H3cPXaZ5Ajq0Q,"As a long-time patron and fan of Sapporo Ramen Porter Exchange, this spot is disappointing. Both the food and the service seem uninspired, the latter (rather defensively) saying the owner makes all the decisions.    Thus, would the owner kindly consider spending some time in Central Square to bring the ""watery"" broth up to your standards, offer takeout (at least for dinner!) and rationalize the pricing? I think you'll see a pick up in business...just sayin'.    Right now I'm going to (less frequently) pick up in Porter rather than grab and go at this far more convenient location.",4,2,female
MOb2hpyT6ZgYVqqHxAxEYA,"I ordered the spicy miso ramen which was not particularly spicy. The ramen here is just okay. If you are at H Mart and need a convenient lunch ordering at Sapporo Ramen is fine, but its not a destination ramen spot. There are plenty of other ramen places in and around Cambridge that are better.",2,2,female
TRcuX-xSBv1pVNKfO99TYQ,"I've been to this Cafe location a few times now. The staff is always friendly and eager to help and take your order. Drinks are always on point. the Aroma of the coffee just takes you in and you sip til the last drop.     This case is very good size compared to a couple of others. very clean and provides free wifi as well as a clean lady's and man's bathroom which is also spacious.     the only thing i don't particular like is the muffins they offer. i realize it's not made by the cafe themselves but wherever they're sourcing it from they suck. they're tiny and has no muffin top. yes, I am a muffin top kinda girl :)     on the upside, really good croissants; i believe i eat them at least twice a week.     If you're a Capitol One customer and use your CapitolOne Credit/Debit card, 50% off on all drinks. It's a GREAT deal :)",4,1,male
FdatTvfRGE6AckWa6exf6A,The food was great! If i lived in this city i would be coming back. The only downfall was the service was slow even when it wasn't crowded. also the scent was a bit off but overall great!,4,1,male
Uj3FaKp9lrRCQBK7Cv6rDg,"I always enjoy coming here to eat sushi, Japanese noodle soup, etc. I never remember the names of the individual restaurants, and I have not tried them all, but what I've had has always been good and inexpensive, and a great choice for lunch when I'm doing errands in Porter Square.",2,1,male
OA5twr8q53C-BXvwXCKxfQ,"Ok.... I have always liked Al's - their Lady Cafe is my favorite but I have an allergic reaction to basil now so I can't eat it anymore :(    But... I was Craving a fresh sub so they are a solid go to.    I ordered through door dash and the restaurant had them call me to inform me of any extra charge for the sides that I chose - confirmed everything but apparently there was a miscommunication lol.      They got the order wrong... BUT... It was still good... Albeit frustrating given the call to confirm everything.    The bread is my favorite!  And the sandwiches are huge!    My father is extremely hard to get an 'it was good' out of.  Usually, ""it was ok"" or ""meh - it wasn't that great"".    But this piqued his interest and asked the name of the place and location!  With a smile! Lol    Go there, they are great!  Crunchy chewy bread! Love.    BUT they can be super busy around lunch time.  I know the Harvard Square location takes the phone off the hook so you may just need to show up and order.    Enjoy!",4,2,female
gEa6iYGJsIyhTV-Xpwszxg,"Sugar & Spice is my jam. Flavorful Pad Thai coupled with a delicious Coconut Smoothie for under $15, love it. It's your standard no-frills, but tries to be cutesie kind of Thai place. The service is well intentioned, but you may puzzle at some of the things they do. Why does half the table get their dishes first? Why do drinks come at the end? Where are the utensils? Seriously, where are the utensils? But they try and you can ask them for whatever it is you're missing. Service aside, Sugar & Spice is an awesome spot, especially for lunch.",4,1,male
g75hXNbOPYcgYqLJ6v0m6A,"I highly recommend this as a healthy, fresh, and *affordable* lunch option in Kendall. I can see and pronounce all ingredients, get a ton of vegetables - and flavor - in my meal, and get out the door for under $10 (more than I can say for Tatte, Commonwealth, Bailey Sage, etc.). Yes, the juices seem a bit pricey (perhaps that's because I see juices as a meal addition, not replacement), but breakfast bowls and salad/entrees are all under $10.    I had the Keen What salad - it was flavorful, fresh, and felt like a solid amount of food for $8. I went in just before noon and got my food in under 5 minutes.    Staff was very friendly but not overbearing, helpful in answering questions, and efficient in serving customers. I'm happy to have Mother Juice in the neighborhood and look forward to trying their other options!",4,1,male
h7sSRVbTeK5XeD1zA9ITBA,"Came here for brunch this Sunday with 4 other people. My son lives nearby, and had been here before.  On this particular day, there was a staffing problem. Our food took especially long to come out. Our server was very apologetic. The cook even came out to apologize. When our meals came out, they were all hot and tasty. We were compensated by not being charged for any of the food! So, even though it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food, it was well worth the wait. I will not hesitate to return and recommend The Rising with no hesitation.",2,2,female
b_ejNLH_4hZPxf94F-L7gQ,"My first review!      Let me just say GREAT SPACE!  Large beautiful windows with tons of natural light! I just loved being in there....and you would never know it from outside but they have a downstairs ( although we didn't make it down but who knew!)    We sat at nice smallish natural wood bar.  Great bar service! Just the the right amount banter and spot on service! They even let the bf save a seat for me as I running a few minutes late. Luckily it was right before before the crowd. Which it did get busy.  It was Friday right after work....      Now the food and drink! We were just getting a few small plates and drinks, but we WILL back for dinner.  The Bison Bolognese looked amazing!    I got the cucumber lemonade. It was muddled cucumber, gin, lemon and super refreshing with the right amount of kick. Just what I wanted after a long work week.  They had a good beer selection and interesting cocktail list.      Now the food! From the small plates we shared...    the cheeseburger and candied bacon egg roll.  It had a great sauce and definitely didn't suck! And the roasted red pepper,goat cheese and linguica arancini balls-um.....yum! It was all just really delicious     We got an appetizer as well....Oven baked Brie,caramelized onions,apples and crostini.-JUST GET IT!",2,2,female
